# **News**

- **2024.05** Our recent paper on an RL-based universal framework for V2X traffic signal control has been accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (IF 6.8). [[Paper Link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05090)

- **2024.03** Our recent paper on diffusion model-based remote sensing super-resolution has been accepted by Remote Sensing (IF 5). [[Paper Link]](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/7/1219)

- **2024.03** We have had another paper accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS) (IF 8.2) within one month! The paper studies the application of the diffusion model in change detection for remote sensing images. [[Paper Link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03424)

- **2024.03** All three of our submissions to the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) have been all accepted, including two oral papers. More importantly, this is the first time that the team has published papers on applying LLM (GPT and SAM) in remote sensing! IGARSS is the flagship conference organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. The team has published 3+ papers at each year's IGARSS since 2021.

- **2024.03** Our two recent papers have been accepted by the 2024 IEEE Conference on Communications (ICC). ICC is the one of the two flagship annual conferences organized by the IEEE ComSoc.

- **2024.02** Our recent joint work with Stanford on reinforcement learning (RL)-based traffic signal control under communication delays has been accepted by the IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology (OJVT) (IF 6.4). [[Paper Link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8782711/8889399/10443835.pdf)

- **2022.10** Our recent joint work with SenseTime on reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control has been accepted by the TRB Annual meeting. TRB is the flag-ship conference in the area of transportation. Check out the paper! [[Paper Link]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13378)

- **2022.08** The conference program for the 31th Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC) is now available online. The conference will be held on a hybrid format on August 11-12, 2022. All are welcome!

- **2022.06** Our recent paper on exploration acceleration for reinforcement learning has been accepted by the IEEE Trans. on Artificial Intelligence.
- **2022.05** Our two recent papers have been accepted by the Journal of Supercomputing and the APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing, respectively. One paper investigates reinforcement learning-based resource allocation for wireless networks while the other 3D map reconstruction.
- **2022.04** Congratulations to our two senior students graduating in 2022. Mr. XU Yang will join the PhD program at Purdue while Mr. LUO Wenyan the PhD program at the Ohio State University (OSU). Both received full PhD scholarships. Furthermore, one of our 2019 senior graduates, Mr. DU Jingxin, has received PhD offers from Duke, Purdue and University of Wisconsin-Madison with full scholarships. Congratulations to Yang, Wenyan and Jingxin!
- **2022.04** Our recent paper on UAV-assisted multi-UGV systems has been accepted by the IEEE Trans. on Vehicular Technology. This work was done when the second author, Ms. WU Lan, was a senior student at CUHKSZ. Ms. Wu is now a PhD student at the National University of Singapore.
- **2022.04** Our four submissions to the 2022 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, have been accepted for publication. IGARSS is the flagship conference organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. This is the second consecutive year for the team to publish four papers at IGARSS.
- **2022.04** Our recent paper on crossmodal multiscale fusion has been accepted by the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.
- **2022.03** Our recent paper on deep learning-based network-level performance prediction has been accepted by the IEEE Trans. on Network Science and Engineering.
- **2022.03** Our recent paper on multilevel deformable attention-aggregated networks has been accepted by the IEEE Trans. on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.
